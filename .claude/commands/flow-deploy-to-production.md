# Production Deployment Orchestration Flow

**You are the Core Orchestrator** for production deployment workflows.

## Your Role

**You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**

When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):

1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
6. **Report completion** with summary

## Deployment Overview

**Purpose**: Safe, validated production deployment with automated rollback capability

**Key Activities**:
- Strategy selection (blue-green, canary, rolling)
- Pre-deployment validation and gate checks
- Progressive deployment with SLO monitoring
- Smoke tests and health validation
- Automated rollback on failure

**Expected Duration**: 30-90 minutes (varies by strategy), 10-15 minutes orchestration

## Natural Language Triggers

Users may say:
- "Deploy to production"
- "Production deployment"
- "Release to prod"
- "Start deployment"
- "Deploy version X.Y.Z"
- "Go live with new release"
- "Execute production rollout"

You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.

## Parameter Handling

### --guidance Parameter

**Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor orchestration priorities

**Examples**:
```
--guidance "Zero-downtime critical, use blue-green strategy"
--guidance "High-risk release, progressive canary with 5% → 25% → 100%"
--guidance "Database migration included, need extended maintenance window"
--guidance "First production deployment, extra validation and monitoring"
```

**How to Apply**:
- Parse guidance for keywords: strategy, risk level, timeline, validation depth
- Adjust strategy selection (blue-green vs. canary vs. rolling)
- Modify validation depth (minimal vs. comprehensive smoke tests)
- Influence monitoring duration (15 min vs. 60 min observation)

### --interactive Parameter

**Purpose**: You ask 6-8 strategic questions to understand deployment context

**Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):

```
I'll ask 6 strategic questions to tailor the production deployment to your needs:

Q1: What deployment strategy do you prefer?
    (blue-green = instant cutover, canary = progressive rollout, rolling = node-by-node)

Q2: What's the risk level of this release?
    (Low = routine updates, Medium = new features, High = architecture changes)

Q3: What are your SLO targets?
    (e.g., error rate <0.1%, latency p99 <500ms, availability >99.95%)

Q4: Is a database migration or schema change included?
    (Affects rollback complexity and strategy selection)

Q5: What's your rollback tolerance?
    (How quickly must you be able to rollback? Instant vs. 5 min vs. 30 min)

Q6: What's your monitoring observation period?
    (How long to monitor before declaring success? 15 min vs. 30 min vs. 60 min)

Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
- Deployment strategy selection
- Smoke test depth and coverage
- SLO monitoring thresholds and duration
- Rollback automation triggers
```

**Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance string for execution

## Artifacts to Generate

**Primary Deliverables**:
- **Deployment Readiness Report**: Pre-flight validation → `.aiwg/deployment/deployment-readiness-report.md`
- **Deployment Execution Log**: Real-time progress tracking → `.aiwg/deployment/deployment-execution-log.md`
- **SLO Monitoring Report**: Metrics and breach detection → `.aiwg/deployment/slo-monitoring-report.md`
- **Deployment Summary Report**: Final outcome and lessons learned → `.aiwg/reports/deployment-report-{version}.md`
- **Rollback Report** (if needed): Rollback execution and RCA → `.aiwg/deployment/rollback-report-{version}.md`

**Supporting Artifacts**:
- Smoke test results (working doc)
- SLO breach alerts (archived)
- Infrastructure health snapshots (archived)

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Workflow

### Step 1: Deployment Strategy Selection

**Purpose**: Choose deployment strategy based on risk, infrastructure, and requirements

**Your Actions**:

1. **Analyze Context**:
   ```
   Read:
   - .aiwg/intake/project-intake.md (understand project constraints)
   - .aiwg/deployment/deployment-plan-*.md (existing deployment plans)
   - .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md (infrastructure capabilities)
   - User guidance (--guidance parameter or interactive answers)
   ```

2. **Launch Strategy Selection Agent**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="deployment-manager",
       description="Recommend deployment strategy",
       prompt="""
       Read project context and architecture documentation

       Recommend deployment strategy based on:

       **Blue-Green Strategy**:
       - When: Zero-downtime critical, instant rollback required
       - Requires: 2x infrastructure capacity (temporary)
       - Pros: Instant cutover, instant rollback, low risk
       - Cons: Higher cost, requires duplicate environments

       **Canary Strategy**:
       - When: Progressive validation needed, high-risk release
       - Requires: Traffic routing capability (Argo Rollouts, Flagger)
       - Pros: Gradual rollout, SLO-driven automation, cost-efficient
       - Cons: Slower rollout, complex automation setup

       **Rolling Strategy**:
       - When: Legacy systems, stateful services, simpler deployments
       - Requires: Basic orchestration (Kubernetes rollout)
       - Pros: No additional infrastructure, simple setup
       - Cons: Slower rollout, manual validation, harder rollback

       Analyze project requirements:
       - Risk level: {from guidance or interactive}
       - Infrastructure: {cloud provider, orchestration platform}
       - Downtime tolerance: {zero vs. minimal vs. acceptable}
       - Rollback requirements: {instant vs. fast vs. manual}

       Recommend strategy with rationale
       Save to: .aiwg/working/deployment/strategy-recommendation.md
       """
   )
   ```

3. **Confirm Strategy with User**:
   ```
   Read .aiwg/working/deployment/strategy-recommendation.md

   Present to user:
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   Deployment Strategy Recommendation
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────

   **Recommended**: {Blue-Green | Canary | Rolling}

   **Rationale**: {why this strategy fits project needs}

   **Trade-offs**:
   - Pros: {list benefits}
   - Cons: {list drawbacks}

   **Requirements**:
   - Infrastructure: {what's needed}
   - Duration: {expected deployment time}
   - Monitoring: {observation period}

   Proceed with this strategy? (yes/no)
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   ```

**Communicate Progress**:
```
✓ Analyzed deployment context
✓ Strategy recommendation: {Blue-Green | Canary | Rolling}
⏳ Awaiting user confirmation...
```

### Step 2: Pre-Deployment Validation

**Purpose**: Verify all quality gates passed and environment is ready

**Your Actions**:

1. **Launch Parallel Validation Agents**:
   ```
   # Agent 1: Quality Gate Validation
   Task(
       subagent_type="project-manager",
       description="Validate all quality gates passed",
       prompt="""
       Check quality gate status for Transition phase

       Read gate criteria: $AIWG_ROOT/.../flows/gate-criteria-by-phase.md (Transition section)

       Validate gates:
       - [ ] Security Gate: No High/Critical vulnerabilities
       - [ ] Reliability Gate: SLOs met in staging
       - [ ] Test Gate: Integration tests 100% passing
       - [ ] Approval Gate: Release Manager signoff obtained

       Generate gate validation report:
       - Status: PASS | FAIL
       - Gate checklist with results
       - Decision: GO | NO-GO
       - Gaps (if NO-GO): List missing approvals or failures

       Save to: .aiwg/working/deployment/gate-validation-report.md
       """
   )

   # Agent 2: Environment Health Check
   Task(
       subagent_type="devops-engineer",
       description="Validate production environment health",
       prompt="""
       Check production environment readiness

       Validate infrastructure health:
       - [ ] All nodes healthy (Kubernetes cluster)
       - [ ] No pods in crash loop or pending state
       - [ ] Database connections healthy
       - [ ] External integrations operational
       - [ ] Monitoring and alerting functional
       - [ ] No active P0/P1 incidents

       Check deployment artifacts:
       - [ ] Container images available and tagged
       - [ ] Checksums verified
       - [ ] Container signatures validated (if required)
       - [ ] Database migrations prepared (if applicable)

       Generate environment health report:
       - Infrastructure status: HEALTHY | DEGRADED | UNHEALTHY
       - Artifacts status: READY | MISSING | INVALID
       - Decision: GO | NO-GO
       - Issues (if NO-GO): List blockers

       Save to: .aiwg/working/deployment/environment-health-report.md
       """
   )

   # Agent 3: Rollback Plan Validation
   Task(
       subagent_type="reliability-engineer",
       description="Validate rollback plan tested and ready",
       prompt="""
       Read rollback plan: .aiwg/deployment/rollback-plan-*.md

       Validate rollback readiness:
       - [ ] Rollback plan documented
       - [ ] Rollback tested in staging (within last 7 days)
       - [ ] Rollback automation configured (scripts, runbooks)
       - [ ] Rollback SLOs defined (how fast can we rollback?)
       - [ ] Communication plan for rollback scenario

       If database migration included:
       - [ ] Migration rollback script tested
       - [ ] Data backup verified
       - [ ] Backup restoration tested

       Generate rollback validation report:
       - Rollback readiness: READY | NOT_READY
       - Rollback strategy: {blue-green instant | canary abort | rolling undo}
       - Rollback SLO: {duration to full rollback}
       - Issues (if NOT_READY): List gaps

       Save to: .aiwg/working/deployment/rollback-validation-report.md
       """
   )
   ```

2. **Synthesize Pre-Deployment Readiness**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="deployment-manager",
       description="Synthesize deployment readiness report",
       prompt="""
       Read all validation reports:
       - .aiwg/working/deployment/gate-validation-report.md
       - .aiwg/working/deployment/environment-health-report.md
       - .aiwg/working/deployment/rollback-validation-report.md

       Synthesize Deployment Readiness Report:

       1. Overall Status: GO | CONDITIONAL_GO | NO-GO
       2. Gate Validation: {status and details}
       3. Environment Health: {status and details}
       4. Rollback Readiness: {status and details}
       5. Pre-Flight Checklist: {comprehensive checklist}
       6. Decision Rationale: {why GO or NO-GO}
       7. Conditions (if CONDITIONAL_GO): {what must be addressed}

       Use template: $AIWG_ROOT/.../templates/deployment/deployment-plan-card.md

       Output: .aiwg/deployment/deployment-readiness-report.md
       """
   )
   ```

3. **Decision Point**:
   ```
   Read .aiwg/deployment/deployment-readiness-report.md

   If GO → Continue to Step 3
   If CONDITIONAL_GO → Present conditions to user, wait for confirmation
   If NO-GO → Report gaps, recommend remediation, STOP deployment
   ```

**Communicate Progress**:
```
⏳ Validating deployment readiness...
  ✓ Quality gates validated: {PASS | FAIL}
  ✓ Environment health checked: {HEALTHY | DEGRADED}
  ✓ Rollback plan validated: {READY | NOT_READY}
✓ Pre-deployment validation: {GO | CONDITIONAL_GO | NO-GO}
```

### Step 3: Execute Deployment (Strategy-Specific)

**Purpose**: Deploy new version using selected strategy with continuous monitoring

#### Blue-Green Deployment

**Your Actions**:

1. **Deploy to Green Environment**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="devops-engineer",
       description="Deploy new version to green environment",
       prompt="""
       Execute blue-green deployment to green environment

       Actions:
       1. Deploy new version to green environment (while blue serves production)
       2. Wait for all green pods to be running and ready
       3. Validate green environment health checks passing

       Log all actions with timestamps to: .aiwg/working/deployment/execution-log-green.md

       Report:
       - Green deployment status: SUCCESS | FAILED
       - Pods running: {count}/{total}
       - Health checks: {PASS | FAIL}
       - Duration: {minutes}

       If FAILED: Stop deployment, do NOT cutover traffic
       """
   )
   ```

2. **Run Smoke Tests on Green**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="qa-engineer",
       description="Execute smoke tests on green environment",
       prompt="""
       Read smoke test plan: $AIWG_ROOT/.../templates/test/smoke-test-checklist.md

       Execute critical path smoke tests:
       - [ ] API health endpoints (200 OK)
       - [ ] User authentication flow
       - [ ] Critical business operations (top 5-10 journeys)
       - [ ] Database connectivity
       - [ ] External integrations (payment gateway, email, etc.)
       - [ ] Monitoring and logging operational

       Test against green environment URL (not production)

       Generate smoke test report:
       - Tests passed: {count}/{total}
       - Tests failed: {list failures with details}
       - Status: PASS | FAIL
       - Duration: {minutes}

       Save to: .aiwg/working/deployment/smoke-test-results-green.md

       If FAIL: Stop deployment, do NOT cutover traffic
       """
   )
   ```

3. **Cutover Traffic to Green**:
   ```
   # Only proceed if green deployment and smoke tests passed

   Task(
       subagent_type="devops-engineer",
       description="Cutover production traffic to green environment",
       prompt="""
       Execute traffic cutover from blue to green

       Actions:
       1. Update load balancer or service selector to point to green
       2. Verify traffic is flowing to green (0% blue → 100% green)
       3. Confirm blue environment still running (for instant rollback)

       Log cutover actions with timestamps

       Report:
       - Cutover status: SUCCESS | FAILED
       - Traffic distribution: {blue-percentage}% blue, {green-percentage}% green
       - Timestamp: {cutover-time}

       Save to: .aiwg/working/deployment/execution-log-cutover.md
       """
   )
   ```

4. **Monitor SLOs Post-Cutover** (Step 4 will handle this)

#### Canary Deployment

**Your Actions**:

1. **Deploy Canary (1-5% Traffic)**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="devops-engineer",
       description="Deploy canary version with 1-5% traffic",
       prompt="""
       Execute canary deployment with progressive rollout

       Stage 1: Deploy canary receiving 1-5% of production traffic

       Actions:
       1. Deploy canary version alongside stable baseline
       2. Configure traffic routing (1-5% to canary, 95-99% to baseline)
       3. Verify canary pods running and healthy

       Log all actions with timestamps

       Report:
       - Canary deployment status: SUCCESS | FAILED
       - Traffic distribution: {canary-percentage}% canary, {baseline-percentage}% baseline
       - Pods running: {count}/{total}
       - Health checks: {PASS | FAIL}

       Save to: .aiwg/working/deployment/execution-log-canary-stage1.md

       If FAILED: Stop deployment, scale down canary
       """
   )
   ```

2. **Launch SLO Monitoring Agent** (runs continuously):
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="reliability-engineer",
       description="Monitor canary SLOs at 1-5% stage",
       prompt="""
       Monitor SLOs for canary vs. baseline for 10-15 minutes

       Compare metrics:
       - Error rate: canary should not exceed baseline by >2%
       - Latency p99: canary should not exceed baseline by >20%
       - Throughput: canary should be proportional to traffic share

       SLO breach detection:
       - If error rate breach: ABORT deployment, trigger rollback
       - If latency breach: ABORT deployment, trigger rollback
       - If infrastructure failure: ABORT deployment, trigger rollback

       Generate monitoring report every 5 minutes:
       - Status: PASS | BREACH
       - Metrics comparison: {baseline vs. canary}
       - Decision: CONTINUE | ABORT

       Save to: .aiwg/working/deployment/slo-monitoring-canary-stage1.md

       If BREACH: Immediately notify orchestrator to trigger rollback
       """
   )
   ```

3. **Progressive Rollout** (if SLOs pass):
   ```
   # If Stage 1 SLOs pass, promote to 25%, then 50%, then 100%
   # Repeat monitoring at each stage

   Task(
       subagent_type="devops-engineer",
       description="Promote canary to 25% traffic",
       prompt="""
       Stage 2: Promote canary to 25% traffic

       Actions:
       1. Update traffic routing (25% canary, 75% baseline)
       2. Verify traffic distribution
       3. Monitor SLOs for 10-15 minutes (launch new monitoring agent)

       Report and save to: .aiwg/working/deployment/execution-log-canary-stage2.md

       If SLO breach at any stage: ABORT, trigger rollback
       """
   )

   # Repeat for 50% and 100% stages
   ```

#### Rolling Deployment

**Your Actions**:

1. **Rolling Update Execution**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="devops-engineer",
       description="Execute rolling deployment node-by-node",
       prompt="""
       Execute rolling deployment strategy

       Actions:
       1. Update 1 instance/node at a time
       2. Wait for new instance to pass health checks
       3. Monitor for 5 minutes before proceeding to next instance
       4. Continue until all instances updated

       Pause conditions:
       - If health check fails: STOP, evaluate, rollback if needed
       - If error rate increases: STOP, evaluate, rollback if needed

       Log all actions with timestamps

       Report:
       - Instances updated: {count}/{total}
       - Current instance status: {status}
       - Health checks: {PASS | FAIL}
       - Error rate: {current vs. baseline}

       Save to: .aiwg/working/deployment/execution-log-rolling.md
       """
   )
   ```

**Communicate Progress** (all strategies):
```
⏳ Executing {Blue-Green | Canary | Rolling} deployment...
  ✓ {Strategy-specific milestone 1}: {status}
  ✓ {Strategy-specific milestone 2}: {status}
  ⏳ {Strategy-specific milestone 3}: In progress...
```

### Step 4: Monitor SLOs and Smoke Tests

**Purpose**: Continuous validation that deployment is meeting reliability targets

**Your Actions**:

1. **Launch Parallel Monitoring Agents**:
   ```
   # Agent 1: SLO Monitoring
   Task(
       subagent_type="reliability-engineer",
       description="Monitor production SLOs post-deployment",
       prompt="""
       Monitor SLOs for 15-30 minutes post-deployment (or as specified in guidance)

       Key SLOs to track:
       - Error rate: {target <0.1% or custom}
       - Latency p99: {target <500ms or custom}
       - Throughput: {baseline ±10% or custom}
       - Availability: {target >99.95% or custom}

       Compare current metrics vs. baseline (pre-deployment)

       Automated breach detection:
       - Error rate >2% above baseline → TRIGGER ROLLBACK
       - Latency p99 >20% above baseline → TRIGGER ROLLBACK
       - Throughput drop >30% below baseline → TRIGGER ROLLBACK
       - Infrastructure alarms triggered → TRIGGER ROLLBACK

       Generate SLO monitoring report every 5 minutes:
       - Status: PASS | BREACH
       - Metrics: {current vs. baseline vs. target}
       - Alerts triggered: {count and details}
       - Decision: CONTINUE | ROLLBACK

       Save to: .aiwg/deployment/slo-monitoring-report.md

       If BREACH: Immediately notify orchestrator to trigger rollback (Step 5)
       """

       - [ ] User authentication and authorization
       - [ ] Top 5-10 business operations
       - [ ] Database read/write operations
       - [ ] External integrations
       - [ ] Monitoring and logging functional

       Test against production URL (real traffic)

       Generate smoke test report:
       - Tests passed: {count}/{total}
       - Tests failed: {list failures with details}
       - Status: PASS | FAIL
       - Duration: {minutes}

       Monitor infrastructure health for 15-30 minutes post-deployment

       Track infrastructure metrics:
       - Pod restarts: >3 restarts in 5 minutes → ALERT
       - OOM kills: Any OOM kill → TRIGGER ROLLBACK
       - Node health: Any unhealthy nodes → ALERT
       - Network errors: Elevated error rates → ALERT

       Generate infrastructure health report every 5 minutes:
       - Status: HEALTHY | DEGRADED | UNHEALTHY
       - Pods: {running}/{total}, restarts: {count}
       - Nodes: {healthy}/{total}
       - Alerts: {list active alerts}

       If UNHEALTHY: Immediately notify orchestrator to trigger rollback
       """
   )
   ```

2. **Aggregate Monitoring Results**:
   ```
   # You monitor all 3 agents continuously
   # If ANY agent reports BREACH, FAIL, or UNHEALTHY → Trigger Step 5 (Rollback)
   # If ALL agents report success for monitoring duration → Proceed to Step 6 (Success)
   ```

**Communicate Progress**:
```
⏳ Monitoring deployment health (15-30 min observation)...
  ✓ SLO monitoring: {PASS | BREACH} (updated every 5 min)
  ✓ Smoke tests: {PASS | FAIL}
  ✓ Infrastructure health: {HEALTHY | DEGRADED}
[If all passing for full duration]
✓ Deployment validation complete: All checks passed
```

### Step 5: Rollback (If Failure Detected)

**Purpose**: Automated rollback execution if SLO breach or failure detected

**Trigger Conditions**:
- SLO breach detected (error rate, latency, throughput)
- Smoke test failure
- Infrastructure health degraded or unhealthy
- Manual abort by user

**Your Actions**:

1. **Execute Strategy-Specific Rollback**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="devops-engineer",
       description="Execute automated rollback",
       prompt="""
       ROLLBACK TRIGGERED: {reason - SLO breach | smoke test failure | infrastructure failure}

       Execute rollback strategy: {Blue-Green | Canary | Rolling}

       **Blue-Green Rollback**:
       1. Switch traffic back to blue environment (instant cutover)
       2. Verify traffic flowing to blue (100% blue, 0% green)
       3. Confirm SLOs return to baseline
       4. Scale down green environment (optional, for cost)

       **Canary Rollback**:
       1. Abort canary rollout (stop progressive promotion)
       2. Scale down canary pods to 0
       3. Verify baseline serving 100% traffic
       4. Confirm SLOs return to baseline

       **Rolling Rollback**:
       1. Trigger rollout undo (revert to previous version)
       2. Wait for all pods to rollback to previous version
       3. Verify all pods running previous version
       4. Confirm SLOs return to baseline

       Log all rollback actions with timestamps

       Report:
       - Rollback trigger: {reason}
       - Rollback strategy: {strategy}
       - Rollback status: SUCCESS | FAILED
       - Duration: {minutes}

       - SLOs post-rollback: {status}

       Save to: .aiwg/deployment/rollback-execution-log.md

       If rollback FAILED: CRITICAL ESCALATION to Incident Commander
       """
   )
   ```

2. **Verify Rollback Success**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="reliability-engineer",
       description="Validate rollback successful",
       prompt="""
       Verify rollback restored stable state

       Validate:
       - [ ] Old version serving 100% traffic
       - [ ] SLOs returned to baseline (error rate, latency)
       - [ ] Smoke tests passing on rolled-back version
       - [ ] No active alerts or incidents

       - Timeline: {deployment start → failure detected → rollback completed}

       Initiate root cause analysis:
       - Assemble incident response team
       - Preserve all logs and metrics (deployment logs, SLO data, infrastructure snapshots)
       - Schedule incident review meeting

       Use template: $AIWG_ROOT/.../templates/deployment/incident-report-template.md

       Output incident report: .aiwg/deployment/rollback-report-{version}.md
       """
   )
   ```

**Communicate Progress**:
```
❌ Deployment failure detected: {reason}
⏳ Executing automated rollback...
  ✓ Rollback execution: {SUCCESS | FAILED}
  ✓ Rollback validation: {SUCCESS | PARTIAL | FAILED}
  ✓ Incident declared: {incident-id}

```

### Step 6: Generate Deployment Report (Success Path)

**Purpose**: Document successful deployment with metrics and lessons learned

**Your Actions**:

1. **Synthesize Deployment Summary**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="deployment-manager",

       Output: .aiwg/reports/deployment-report-{version}.md
       """
   )
   ```

2. **Archive Workflow Artifacts**:
   ```
   # You handle archiving directly

   Archive complete deployment workflow:
   - Move .aiwg/working/deployment/ to .aiwg/archive/{date}/deployment-{version}/

   - Final deployment report location
   ```

**Communicate Progress**:
```
⏳ Generating deployment report...
✓ Deployment report complete: .aiwg/reports/deployment-report-{version}.md
✓ Workflow archived: .aiwg/archive/{date}/deployment-{version}/
```

### Step 7: Notify Stakeholders and Update Documentation

**Purpose**: Communicate deployment outcome and update operational documentation

**Your Actions**:

1. **Generate Stakeholder Notification**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="support-lead",
       description="Draft stakeholder notification",
       prompt="""

       Audience:
       - Executive stakeholders
       - Product team
       - Customer support team
       - Engineering team

       Save notification draft to: .aiwg/working/deployment/stakeholder-notification-{version}.md

       Note: User must review and send notification
       """
   )
   ```

2. **Update Operational Runbooks**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="deployment-manager",
       description="Update deployment runbooks with lessons learned",
       prompt="""
       Read lessons learned from deployment report
