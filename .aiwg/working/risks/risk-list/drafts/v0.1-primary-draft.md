## Detailed Risk Register

### RISK-001: Low Team Adoption
**Category**: Business
**Status**: Open
**Owner**: Product Owner / Engineering Team Lead

**Description**:
The tool may fail to achieve the 80% team adoption target within 2 months due to poor user experience, installation complexity, or lack of perceived value over existing workflows. If adoption remains below 50% by Month 2, the project fails to deliver meaningful ROI.

**Likelihood**: Medium
- Early internal tools often face adoption challenges
- Competing priorities may prevent team members from trying new tools
- Installation friction (Python, FFmpeg) creates barriers to first use

**Impact**: High (Score: 4)
- Project ROI depends on team adoption for productivity gains
- Below 50% adoption makes payback period >2 years (unsustainable)
- Low adoption signals product-market fit failure
- Team continues using inefficient manual workflows

**Risk Score**: 12 (Medium × High = 3 × 4)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Early Demos and Evangelism**:
   - Week 2: Demo PoC to 2-3 early adopters for feedback
   - Week 4: Team-wide demo showcasing time savings (before/after comparison)
   - Monthly: Share success stories and usage metrics with team

2. **Gather Continuous Feedback**:
   - Bi-weekly check-ins with early adopters during MVP development
   - Month 1 survey: Identify friction points and feature gaps
   - Dedicated Slack channel for real-time feedback and support

3. **Iterative UX Improvements**:
   - Prioritize ease-of-use fixes based on feedback (e.g., simpler install, better error messages)
   - Target 10-minute first-run experience (install to first transcript)
   - Rich progress bars and clear status updates for user confidence

4. **Documentation Excellence**:
   - Clear README with platform-specific installation guides (Windows FFmpeg priority)
   - Quick start guide: 3 commands from install to first transcript
   - Troubleshooting guide for common errors (FFmpeg missing, API key invalid)

5. **Team Incentives**:
   - Integrate tool into team workflows (e.g., meeting recap process)
   - Leadership endorsement and usage modeling
   - Track and celebrate milestones (first 5 users, 100 transcriptions)

**Monitoring**:
- Weekly: Track unique users (via opt-in telemetry or manual survey)
- Month 1: Target 40-50% team trying tool at least once
- Month 2: Validate 80% regular usage (at least 1x/week)

**Contingency Plan**:
- If adoption <50% by Month 1: Conduct user interviews to identify blockers, pivot UX or scope
- If adoption <60% by Month 2: Reassess project value, consider pause/pivot

### RISK-002: Scope Creep
**Category**: Business
**Status**: Open
**Owner**: Product Owner / Project Manager

**TOP 3 RISK - DETAILED MITIGATION PLAN**

**Description**:
The 1-3 month MVP timeline with comprehensive feature set (audio extraction, transcription, batch processing, multiple output formats, large file handling) creates high risk of scope expansion. User requests for additional features (speaker ID, summaries, cloud integration, real-time transcription) during development could extend timeline significantly, delaying ROI and team frustration.

**Likelihood**: High
- Users naturally request features once they see working prototype
- Team may want to "just add one more thing" for completeness
- No formal scope change control process defined yet
- Ambitious feature list already in intake (VTT, JSON, summaries)

**Impact**: High (Score: 4)
- Timeline extension from 3 months to 6+ months delays productivity gains
- Developer frustration with moving targets
- Risk of never reaching "done" state (perpetual beta)
- Delayed adoption while waiting for "complete" feature set

**Risk Score**: 20 (High × High = 5 × 4) - **HIGHEST RISK**

**Detailed Mitigation Strategy**:

**1. Strict MVP Scope Definition (Week 1 - Inception)**:
- Document non-negotiable MVP features (MKV extraction, audio transcription, TXT + SRT output)
- Explicitly list deferred features for v2 (speaker ID, summaries, VTT, JSON, cloud storage)
- Get stakeholder sign-off on MVP scope before Construction phase
- Create "v2 Backlog" parking lot for future requests

**2. Ruthless Prioritization Framework**:
- Every feature request evaluated against criteria:
  - **Must-Have**: Blocks 80% team adoption or core workflow
  - **Should-Have**: Enhances UX but not required for MVP
  - **Nice-to-Have**: Defer to v2 or later
- Product Owner has final authority on scope decisions
- Default answer: "Great idea for v2, let's validate MVP first"

**3. 2-Week Sprint Cadence with Gate Reviews**:
- Sprint 0 (Weeks 1-2): Architecture + PoC
- Sprint 1 (Weeks 3-4): Audio extraction module
- Sprint 2 (Weeks 5-6): Transcription module
- Sprint 3 (Weeks 7-8): Batch processing + output formats
- Sprint 4 (Weeks 9-10): Large file handling + testing
- Sprint 5 (Weeks 11-12): Documentation + polish
- Each sprint ends with scope review: "Are we on track for 3-month target?"

**4. Feature Freeze Policy**:
- Week 8 (end of Sprint 3): Feature freeze for MVP
- Weeks 9-12: Bug fixes, testing, documentation only
- Any new features automatically go to v2 backlog
- Exceptions require Product Owner approval + timeline extension acknowledgment

**5. User Expectation Management**:
- Communicate MVP limitations upfront in demos
- Emphasize "get it working, then iterate" philosophy
- Share v2 roadmap transparency (speaker ID, summaries coming later)
- Celebrate MVP completion as milestone, not endpoint

**6. Scope Change Control**:
- Formalize lightweight change request process:
  - Requestor: Describe feature + business value
  - Product Owner: Evaluate MVP impact (timeline, complexity)
  - Decision: Accept (extend timeline), Defer (v2), or Reject
- Track all change requests in `.aiwg/planning/change-log.md`

**Monitoring**:
- **Weekly** (Sprint Standups):
  - Review active work items vs. original Sprint plan
  - Flag any scope additions (even small) for Product Owner review
- **Bi-Weekly** (Sprint Reviews):
  - Assess cumulative scope drift
  - Velocity check: On track for 3-month timeline?
- **Monthly** (Stakeholder Check-In):
  - Report scope status: "MVP on track" vs. "extended to X months"

**Success Metrics**:
- Zero unauthorized scope additions (all changes approved by Product Owner)
- MVP delivered within 3 months (+/- 2 weeks acceptable)
- v2 backlog contains 10+ deferred features (evidence of discipline)

**Contingency Plan**:
- If timeline extends beyond 4 months: Conduct scope cut (remove batch processing or large file handling from MVP)
- If team pressure for features is high: Schedule "v2 Planning Session" to acknowledge and roadmap requests

**Escalation**:
- If scope creep threatens 6+ month timeline, escalate to Engineering Team Lead for executive decision: Cut scope or extend timeline with explicit trade-off acknowledgment

### RISK-003: FFmpeg Installation Barrier
**Category**: Technical
**Status**: Open
**Owner**: Tech Lead / Developer

**TOP 3 RISK - DETAILED MITIGATION PLAN**

**Description**:
FFmpeg is a required external dependency for audio extraction from MKV files and format conversion. Many users, especially on Windows, may not have FFmpeg installed or properly configured in their system PATH. Installation complexity (manual download, PATH configuration, multiple platform-specific steps) creates a significant barrier to first use, potentially blocking 30-40% of users from successfully running the tool.

**Likelihood**: High
- Windows users face manual installation (no default package manager)
- PATH configuration is non-obvious for non-technical users
- No existing FFmpeg installation for most team members
- First-run failure creates negative first impression

**Impact**: Medium (Score: 3)
- Blocks core functionality (MKV audio extraction)
- High support burden (repeated installation help)
- User frustration and abandonment before first successful use
- Reduces team adoption rate significantly

**Risk Score**: 15 (High × Medium = 5 × 3) - **TOP 3 RISK**

**Detailed Mitigation Strategy**:

**1. Comprehensive Platform-Specific Installation Documentation (Week 1 Priority)**:

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg -y
# Verify installation
ffmpeg -version
```

**macOS (Homebrew)**:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
# Verify installation
ffmpeg -version
```

**Windows (Manual Installation - PRIORITY DOCUMENTATION)**:
- Download FFmpeg from official site: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
- Extract to `C:\ffmpeg\` (or preferred location)
- Add `C:\ffmpeg\bin` to System PATH:
  1. Right-click "This PC" → Properties
  2. Advanced system settings → Environment Variables
  3. Under "System variables", find "Path", click Edit
  4. Click New, add `C:\ffmpeg\bin`
  5. Click OK on all dialogs
  6. Restart terminal/command prompt
- Verify: Open CMD and run `ffmpeg -version`

**Windows (Alternative - Chocolatey)**:
```bash
choco install ffmpeg -y
# Verify installation
ffmpeg -version
```

**2. Startup Validation with Helpful Error Messages**:
```python
# On CLI startup, check for FFmpeg
def check_ffmpeg():
    try:
        subprocess.run(["ffmpeg", "-version"], capture_output=True, check=True)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("""
        ERROR: FFmpeg not found in PATH.

        FFmpeg is required for audio extraction from video files.

        Installation instructions:
        - Linux: sudo apt install ffmpeg
        - macOS: brew install ffmpeg
        - Windows: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html (see README for PATH setup)

        After installation, restart your terminal and try again.

        For detailed troubleshooting: https://github.com/[repo]/blob/main/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#ffmpeg-not-found
        """)
        sys.exit(1)
```

**3. Windows-Specific Installation Guide (First Documentation Deliverable)**:
- Create `docs/INSTALL_WINDOWS_FFMPEG.md` in Week 1
- Include screenshots for PATH configuration
- Video walkthrough (2-3 minutes) for visual learners
- Link prominently from main README
- Test guide with 2-3 Windows users before release

**4. Consider Bundled FFmpeg Binaries (v1.1 Enhancement)**:
- Research FFmpeg licensing (LGPL allows bundling if dynamically linked)
- Package platform-specific FFmpeg binaries with tool
- Auto-detect and use bundled binary if system FFmpeg not found
- Reduces installation friction to zero for future users
- **Decision Point**: Week 4 (after evaluating installation success rate)

**5. Pre-Installation Test Script**:
- Provide `check_dependencies.py` script for users to test environment
```python
# check_dependencies.py
def check_all():
    checks = {
        "Python": check_python_version(),  # 3.9+
        "FFmpeg": check_ffmpeg(),
        "OpenAI API Key": check_api_key()
    }
    # Report results with pass/fail and remediation links
```

**6. Troubleshooting Guide Section**:
- Dedicated "FFmpeg Installation Issues" section in docs
- Common errors:
  - "ffmpeg: command not found" → Installation guide
  - "PATH not updated" → Restart terminal instructions
  - "FFmpeg version too old" → Upgrade instructions
- Platform-specific troubleshooting (Windows focus)

**Monitoring**:
- **Week 1-2** (Early Adopters):
  - Track installation success rate (how many users succeed on first try?)
  - Collect feedback: "How difficult was FFmpeg installation? (1-5 scale)"
- **Month 1**:
  - Measure: What % of users need installation help?
  - Target: <20% require support for FFmpeg setup
- **Month 2**:
  - Reassess bundled binary approach if installation failure rate >30%

**Success Metrics**:
- 80%+ users successfully install FFmpeg without support
- Average time-to-first-run <10 minutes (including FFmpeg install)
- <5 GitHub Issues related to FFmpeg installation by Month 2

**Contingency Plan**:
- If installation failure rate >40% by Week 4: Fast-track bundled FFmpeg binaries for v0.2 release
- If Windows installation particularly problematic: Create automated installer script (PowerShell) for one-click FFmpeg setup

**Escalation**:
- If FFmpeg installation blocks >50% of users: Escalate to Tech Lead for alternative architecture (switch to pure Python audio library like pydub, accepting format limitations)

### RISK-004: Large File Handling Failures
**Category**: Technical
**Status**: Open
**Owner**: Tech Lead / Developer

**TOP 3 RISK - DETAILED MITIGATION PLAN**

**Description**:
Processing files >1GB (2+ hour recordings from podcasts, lectures, all-hands meetings) presents multiple challenges: OpenAI Whisper API has 25MB file size limit requiring chunking, memory constraints during file processing, potential timeouts for long-running API calls, and complexity of resume logic for interrupted transcriptions. Failure to handle large files blocks a key use case for content creators and researchers (secondary persona).

**Likelihood**: Medium
- 2+ hour recordings are common for team (weekly all-hands, conferences, podcasts)
- API file size limit is hard constraint (25MB)
- Chunking adds implementation complexity
- Timeout issues with long API calls are likely

**Impact**: High (Score: 4)
- Blocks secondary persona's primary use case (podcast/lecture transcription)
- User frustration with failed jobs after waiting 30+ minutes
- Lost productivity (have to manually chunk files before processing)
- Negative word-of-mouth from failed large file attempts

**Risk Score**: 15 (Medium × High = 3 × 4) - **TOP 3 RISK**

**Detailed Mitigation Strategy**:

**1. Automatic File Chunking Implementation (Sprint 4 - Weeks 9-10)**:

**Chunking Strategy**:
- Target chunk size: 20MB (buffer below 25MB API limit)
- Smart splitting approach:
  - Option A (MVP): Fixed-time segments (e.g., 10-minute chunks at typical bitrate)
  - Option B (v2): Silence detection for natural breaks (avoids mid-sentence splits)
- FFmpeg-based chunking:
```python
# Pseudo-code for file chunking
def chunk_audio_file(file_path, chunk_duration_minutes=10):
    """Split audio into chunks using FFmpeg"""
    duration = get_audio_duration(file_path)
    num_chunks = ceil(duration / (chunk_duration_minutes * 60))

    for i in range(num_chunks):
        start_time = i * chunk_duration_minutes * 60
        ffmpeg.input(file_path, ss=start_time, t=chunk_duration_minutes*60) \
              .output(f"chunk_{i}.mp3") \
              .run()
    return [chunk_0.mp3, chunk_1.mp3, ...]
```

**2. Progress Indicators for Long-Running Jobs**:
- Use `rich` library for multi-stage progress bars:
  - Stage 1: "Analyzing file" (duration detection)
  - Stage 2: "Chunking audio" (X of Y chunks created)
  - Stage 3: "Transcribing chunks" (X of Y chunks processed)
  - Stage 4: "Merging transcripts" (final assembly)
- Display estimated time remaining based on API latency
- Update every 5-10 seconds to show liveness

**3. Resume Support for Interrupted Transcriptions**:
- Checkpointing system:
  - Save each chunk's transcript immediately after API response
  - Track state in JSON manifest: `job_state.json`
    ```json
    {
      "file": "lecture.mp3",
      "total_chunks": 12,
      "completed_chunks": [0, 1, 2, 3],
      "pending_chunks": [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11],
      "chunk_transcripts": {
        "0": "chunk_0_transcript.txt",
        "1": "chunk_1_transcript.txt"
      }
    }
    ```
  - On re-run: Skip completed chunks, process only pending
- CLI flag: `--resume <job-id>` to continue interrupted job

**4. Timeout Handling and Retry Logic**:
- Set reasonable API timeout (e.g., 120 seconds per chunk)
- Exponential backoff retry (3 attempts per chunk)
- If chunk fails after retries: Log error, skip chunk, continue with next
- Final report: "11 of 12 chunks successful (chunk 5 failed, manually retry?)"

**5. Testing with Real Large Files (Sprint 4)**:
- Obtain sample files for testing:
  - 2-hour podcast (MP3, ~180MB)
  - 3-hour conference talk (MKV video, ~1.2GB)
  - 4-hour all-hands meeting (MKV, ~2GB if available)
- Test scenarios:
  - End-to-end processing (success path)
  - Interrupt mid-processing, test resume
  - Network failure during chunk upload
  - API timeout simulation
- Document expected processing times (e.g., "2-hour file: 15-20 min total")

**6. User Documentation and Expectations**:
- README section: "Large File Handling"
  - Explain chunking approach
  - Document expected processing times (1 hour audio ≈ 7-10 min processing)
  - Recommend file sizes: <500MB for smooth experience, >1GB supported but slower
- Troubleshooting guide:
  - "Transcription interrupted? Use `--resume` flag"
  - "Chunk failed? Retry with `--retry-failed-chunks`"

**7. Memory-Efficient Streaming Processing**:
- Avoid loading entire file into memory
- Use streaming FFmpeg output to temp files
- Clean up temp chunks after successful transcription
- Monitor memory usage during testing (<500MB for 2GB file processing)

**Monitoring**:
- **Sprint 4** (Development):
  - Test with 2-3 hour files, track success rate
  - Measure memory footprint and processing time
- **Month 1** (Post-Release):
  - Track large file processing success rate (>1GB files)
  - Collect user feedback: "Did large file handling work as expected?"
- **Month 2**:
  - Target: 90%+ success rate for files up to 2GB
  - Average processing time: <10 min per hour of audio

**Success Metrics**:
- 90%+ success rate for files up to 2GB
- Resume functionality works in 95%+ of interrupted job scenarios
- <5 GitHub Issues related to large file failures by Month 2

**Contingency Plan**:
- If chunking implementation exceeds 2 weeks: Defer large file support to v1.1, document 500MB file size limit for MVP
- If success rate <80% for large files: Investigate alternative APIs or local Whisper model for large file processing

**Escalation**:
- If large file handling blocks secondary persona adoption: Escalate to Product Owner for scope decision (defer to v2 or prioritize fix)

---

### RISK-005: API Rate Limits During Batch Processing
**Category**: Technical
**Status**: Open
**Owner**: Developer

**Description**:
OpenAI enforces rate limits on Whisper API requests (varies by account tier: free, pay-as-you-go, enterprise). During batch processing (e.g., 20 meeting recordings from a conference), the tool may hit rate limits causing delays or failed jobs. Users may not understand rate limit errors and abandon the tool.

**Likelihood**: Medium
- Batch processing is core feature (transcribe multiple files at once)
- Rate limits depend on OpenAI account tier (unknown for team members)
- Concurrent API calls increase likelihood of hitting limits

**Impact**: Medium (Score: 3)
- Delays in batch job completion (waits for rate limit reset)
- Failed jobs require manual retry
- User frustration with unclear error messages
- Reduced productivity gains if batches frequently fail

**Risk Score**: 9 (Medium × Medium = 3 × 3)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Exponential Backoff and Retry Logic**:
   - Use `openai` SDK's built-in retry with exponential backoff
   - Configure retry strategy: 3 attempts with 2x backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
   - Graceful degradation: If rate-limited, queue pending requests

2. **Configurable Concurrency Limits**:
   - Default: 5 concurrent API requests (conservative)
   - Config option: `--max-concurrent <N>` (user can reduce to 1-3 for free tier)
   - Auto-detect rate limits and reduce concurrency dynamically

3. **Clear Rate Limit Error Messages**:
```python
# Example error message
"""
ERROR: OpenAI API rate limit exceeded.

Your account tier has a limit of X requests per minute.

Recommendations:
- Reduce concurrency: Use --max-concurrent 2 for smaller batches
- Wait and retry: Rate limits reset after 60 seconds
- Upgrade account: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing

Batch job paused. Retry in 60 seconds? (Y/n)
"""
```

4. **Rate Limit Status in Progress Indicators**:
   - Display current API usage: "Processing (3/10 files, 2 in flight, 5 queued)"
   - Show backoff status: "Rate limited - retrying in 30s..."

5. **Documentation**:
   - README section: "Batch Processing and Rate Limits"
   - Explain OpenAI rate limits (link to OpenAI docs)
   - Recommend account tier for heavy usage (pay-as-you-go vs. free)

**Monitoring**:
- Month 1: Track rate limit errors in logs
- Survey users: "Did you encounter rate limit errors? How often?"
- Adjust default concurrency if >20% of batch jobs hit rate limits

**Contingency Plan**:
- If rate limits frequently block batches: Reduce default concurrency to 3 or implement queue-based processing with user-configurable rate

---

### RISK-006: Whisper API Pricing/Policy Changes
**Category**: External
**Status**: Open
**Owner**: Product Owner / Project Manager

**Description**:
OpenAI may change Whisper API pricing (currently $0.006/minute), increase costs, or modify terms of service (e.g., data retention policies, usage restrictions). Price increases could make the tool cost-prohibitive (budget threshold: $50/month for 10-person team). Policy changes around data privacy could require re-evaluation of tool usage for sensitive meeting content.

**Likelihood**: Low
- OpenAI APIs are generally stable with advance notice for changes
- Whisper API is mature product (released 2022)
- Pricing has been consistent for 2+ years

**Impact**: High (Score: 4)
- Pricing increase >3x makes tool unsustainable vs. commercial alternatives
- Policy changes (e.g., data retention) could violate team's privacy expectations
- Requires migration to alternative (local Whisper, different API)
- Loss of investment in API-based architecture

**Risk Score**: 10 (Low × High = 2 × 5)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Monitor OpenAI Changelog and Announcements**:
   - Subscribe to OpenAI API updates: https://platform.openai.com/docs/changelog
   - Quarterly review of pricing and policy (schedule in calendar)

2. **Budget Monitoring**:
   - Track monthly API costs via OpenAI dashboard
   - Alert if costs exceed $40/month (80% of $50 threshold)
   - Month 2 analysis: Validate estimated costs vs. actual usage

3. **Plan Local Whisper Migration Path (v2 Consideration)**:
   - Research local Whisper alternatives (whisper.cpp, faster-whisper)
   - Prototype local model integration in Sprint 4 (optional spike)
   - Document migration path if API costs become unsustainable

4. **Use Official SDK**:
   - `openai` Python SDK abstracts API changes
   - Pin SDK version in `requirements.txt`, test before upgrading
   - SDK updates usually maintain backward compatibility

5. **Cost Per Transcription Tracking**:
   - Log cost estimate per job: "Estimated cost: $0.18 (30 min audio)"
   - Provide cost report: `transcribe --cost-report` shows monthly usage
   - Help users understand cost implications of heavy usage

**Monitoring**:
- Monthly: Review API costs and compare to budget
- Quarterly: Check OpenAI changelog for pricing/policy updates
- Month 6: Reassess cost sustainability vs. initial estimates

**Contingency Plan**:
- If pricing increases >2x: Evaluate local Whisper model or alternative APIs (Azure Speech, Google Cloud Speech)
- If policy changes violate privacy: Require local Whisper migration for sensitive content

### RISK-007: Part-Time Team Availability
**Category**: Resource
**Status**: Open
**Owner**: Engineering Team Lead

**Description**:
The development team (2-5 developers) has competing priorities and may only allocate 20-40% capacity to this project. Part-time allocation could slow development velocity, extend the 1-3 month timeline, or lead to context-switching inefficiencies. Unexpected team member unavailability (PTO, competing urgent work) could further delay progress.

**Likelihood**: Medium
- Internal tools often receive part-time allocation vs. customer-facing work
- Competing priorities are typical for small teams
- 1-3 month timeline assumes consistent availability

**Impact**: Medium (Score: 3)
- Timeline extension from 3 months to 4-5 months
- Loss of momentum and context switching costs
- Delayed productivity gains and ROI
- Risk of project abandonment if priorities shift

**Risk Score**: 9 (Medium × Medium = 3 × 3)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Ruthless Prioritization**:
   - Focus on MVP core features only (defer nice-to-haves)
   - Leverage existing libraries (ffmpeg-python, openai SDK) to minimize custom code
   - Avoid over-engineering: Simple solutions for MVP

2. **Realistic Sprint Planning**:
   - Assume 20-30% team capacity for planning (conservative)
   - 2-week sprints with achievable goals (2-3 features per sprint)
   - Buffer for unexpected delays (assume 1 sprint slip in 6-sprint plan)

3. **Clear Role Assignments**:
   - Assign primary developer per module (audio extraction, transcription, batch)
   - Avoid shared ownership (reduces coordination overhead)
   - Code reviews by secondary developer (maintain knowledge distribution)

4. **Knowledge Documentation**:
   - Document design decisions in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
   - Maintain up-to-date README and code comments
   - Reduces onboarding time if team members rotate

5. **Team Commitment and Prioritization**:
   - Secure Engineering Team Lead commitment for 20-40% allocation
   - Block calendar time for sprint work (reduce context switching)
   - Communicate priorities to avoid last-minute urgent interruptions

**Monitoring**:
- Bi-weekly sprint reviews: Track velocity and availability
- Adjust timeline if velocity <50% of planned (extend to 4-5 months)
- Monthly stakeholder update: "On track" vs. "delayed due to capacity"

**Contingency Plan**:
- If availability drops below 20%: Pause project or extend timeline to 6 months
- If key developer becomes unavailable: Reassign work, accept timeline delay

### RISK-008: 1-3 Month Timeline Too Aggressive
**Category**: Schedule
**Status**: Open
**Owner**: Project Manager / Tech Lead

**Description**:
The 1-3 month timeline for MVP delivery may be too aggressive given the comprehensive feature set (audio extraction, transcription, batch processing, multiple output formats, large file handling, testing, documentation) and part-time team availability. Underestimating complexity in FFmpeg integration, API chunking, or error handling could lead to rushed quality, skipped testing, or timeline slippage.

**Likelihood**: Medium
- Ambitious feature list for 3 months with part-time team
- Unknowns in FFmpeg integration and large file handling
- Testing and documentation often underestimated

**Impact**: High (Score: 4)
- Timeline extension to 4-6 months delays ROI
- Rushed quality leads to bugs and poor UX (low adoption)
- Developer burnout if timeline pressure is high
- Risk of declaring "MVP done" prematurely with critical issues

**Risk Score**: 15 (Medium × High = 3 × 4)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Phased MVP Scope**:
   - **Phase 1 (Months 1-2)**: Audio extraction + basic transcription (single file, TXT output)
   - **Phase 2 (Month 3)**: Batch processing + SRT format + large file handling
   - Declare Phase 1 as "usable beta" to get early feedback

2. **MVP Scope Enforcement**:
   - Strictly defer non-essential features to v2:
     - Speaker identification: v2
     - AI summaries: v2
     - VTT format: v2
     - Cloud storage: v2
   - Focus on core workflow: Extract → Transcribe → TXT/SRT output

3. **2-Week Sprint Reviews**:
   - Assess progress every 2 weeks
   - Adjust timeline at Sprint 2 (Week 4) if velocity is <50% planned
   - Communicate timeline extension early (avoid last-minute surprises)

4. **Realistic Estimation**:
   - Sprint 0 (Weeks 1-2): Architecture + PoC (validate FFmpeg, API integration)
   - Sprint 1 (Weeks 3-4): Audio extraction module
   - Sprint 2 (Weeks 5-6): Transcription module
   - Sprint 3 (Weeks 7-8): Batch processing + output formats
   - Sprint 4 (Weeks 9-10): Large file handling + testing
   - Sprint 5 (Weeks 11-12): Documentation + polish
   - **Buffer**: 2 weeks for slippage (total: 14 weeks = 3.5 months)

5. **Acceptance Criteria for Timeline**:
   - If timeline extends beyond 4 months: Cut scope (remove batch or large file support)
   - Prefer working MVP with limited features over delayed comprehensive release

**Monitoring**:
- Sprint 2 (Week 4): Assess velocity, project remaining timeline
- Sprint 4 (Week 8): Validate 3-month target feasibility
- Communicate timeline extension at first sign of slippage (don't wait until deadline)

**Contingency Plan**:
- If timeline extends to 4-5 months: Accept and communicate revised timeline
- If beyond 5 months: Cut scope (defer batch processing or large files to v1.1)

### RISK-009: Audio Format Compatibility Issues
**Category**: Technical
**Status**: Open
**Owner**: Developer

**Description**:
Real-world audio and video files may have unusual codecs, corrupted metadata, or proprietary formats that fail FFmpeg extraction or Whisper API transcription. Edge cases like unsupported codecs (WMA, RA), variable bitrate files, or multi-track MKV videos could cause processing failures.

**Likelihood**: Medium
- Real-world files have format quirks and edge cases
- Team's file sources vary (Zoom, Teams, OBS, Audacity, etc.)
- Unknown codec compatibility until tested

**Impact**: Medium (Score: 3)
- Specific files fail to process (not all, but frustrating)
- Support burden for format-related errors
- Users may need manual conversion workarounds

**Risk Score**: 9 (Medium × Medium = 3 × 3)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Extensive Format Testing**:
   - Create test suite with diverse samples:
     - MKV (AAC, MP3, FLAC audio tracks)
     - MP3 (CBR, VBR)
     - AAC (M4A container)
     - FLAC (lossless)
     - WAV (PCM, ADPCM)
   - Include corrupted/malformed samples for error handling tests

2. **Graceful Error Handling**:
   - Detect file format via FFmpeg probe before processing
   - Clear error messages for unsupported formats:
```python
"""
ERROR: Unsupported audio format (WMA).

Supported formats: MKV, MP3, AAC, FLAC, WAV, M4A

Recommendation: Convert to MP3 using FFmpeg:
  ffmpeg -i input.wma output.mp3

Then retry: transcribe output.mp3
"""
```

3. **FFmpeg Conversion Fallback**:
   - For unsupported formats, auto-convert to WAV (universal):
   - `ffmpeg -i input.wma -ar 16000 -ac 1 temp.wav`
   - Transcribe WAV, then delete temp file

4. **Document Supported Formats**:
   - README section: "Supported File Formats"
   - List tested and verified formats
   - Note: "Other formats may work but are not guaranteed"

5. **Format Detection and Validation**:
```python
def validate_audio_file(file_path):
    probe = ffmpeg.probe(file_path)
    codec = probe['streams'][0]['codec_name']
    if codec not in SUPPORTED_CODECS:
        raise UnsupportedFormatError(codec)
```

**Monitoring**:
- Month 1: Track format-related errors in logs
- Survey: "What file formats do you use most?"
- Expand test suite based on real-world usage

**Contingency Plan**:
- If >10% failures due to formats: Implement universal WAV conversion preprocessing step

### RISK-010: API Reliability and Outages
**Category**: External
**Status**: Open
**Owner**: Developer

**Description**:
OpenAI Whisper API may experience temporary outages, degraded performance, or network issues causing transcription failures. Tool depends on third-party service availability (~99.9% uptime typically, but occasional outages occur).

**Likelihood**: Low
- OpenAI has good uptime track record (~99.9%)
- Outages are infrequent and typically short (<1 hour)

**Impact**: Medium (Score: 3)
- Tool unusable during outages
- Delays in transcription workflows
- User frustration if outage occurs during critical work
- No alternative workflow during downtime

**Risk Score**: 6 (Low × Medium = 2 × 3)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**:
   - OpenAI SDK handles transient failures automatically
   - Configure retry strategy: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
   - Total retry time: ~15 seconds before declaring failure

2. **Clear Error Messages with Status Page Link**:
```python
"""
ERROR: Unable to connect to OpenAI Whisper API.

This may be a temporary outage or network issue.

Check OpenAI status: https://status.openai.com

Recommendations:
- Wait 5-10 minutes and retry
- Check your internet connection
- Verify API key is valid

If issue persists, file a bug report.
"""
```

3. **Offline Mode Consideration (v2)**:
   - Research local Whisper model integration (whisper.cpp)
   - Provide fallback for critical workflows during outages
   - Document trade-offs (local model: slower, lower accuracy, but offline)

4. **Status Page Monitoring**:
   - Document OpenAI status page in README
   - Recommend users subscribe to status updates

**Monitoring**:
- Track API failure rate in logs (distinguish network vs. API issues)
- Month 1: Measure actual API reliability based on team usage

**Contingency Plan**:
- If API reliability <99%: Investigate alternative APIs (Azure Speech, Google Cloud) or local models

### Risk Escalation Path
1. **Developer → Tech Lead**: Technical risks blocking development
2. **Tech Lead → Product Owner**: Business/timeline risks requiring scope decisions
3. **Product Owner → Engineering Team Lead**: High-impact risks threatening project success

### Risk Status Definitions
- **Open**: Risk identified, mitigation planned but not yet implemented
- **Mitigating**: Mitigation actions in progress, monitoring for effectiveness
- **Closed**: Risk retired (no longer applicable or successfully mitigated)
- **Accepted**: Risk acknowledged, team accepts potential impact (no further mitigation)

### Risk Ownership
- **Product Owner**: Business risks (adoption, scope)
- **Tech Lead**: Technical risks (FFmpeg, large files, API integration)
- **Project Manager**: Schedule and resource risks
- **Engineering Team Lead**: External risks and escalations
